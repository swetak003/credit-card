Fraud Detection of Credit Card
In recent years, credit and debit card fraud has become a serious issue for both financial institutions 
and consumers. With approximately 52,304 cases of fraud reported in FY’23 alone, the number of 
fraudulent activities is increasing at an alarming rate. This has resulted in substantial financial losses 
for banks, as they are often responsible for compensating the fraudulent transactions, and it has 
significantly eroded customer trust. Therefore, the need to detect fraudulent transactions swiftly 
has become a priority to protect the bank’s financial stability and maintain customer satisfaction. 
Every time a fraudulent credit card transaction occurs, it results in a direct financial loss for the 
bank. Additionally, these incidents can damage the bank’s reputation, further decreasing trust and 
affecting overall customer relationships. As fraud continues to rise, banks must employ efficient and 
effective methods to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. This project aims to identify and 
predict fraudulent transactions using advanced machine learning models to reduce financial losses 
and ensure a secure transaction environment.In recent years, credit and debit card fraud has become a serious issue for both financial institutions
